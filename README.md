## Self-host

As of time of writing, this bot doesn't have a fully functional 24/7 hoster.
So you may have to host the bot yourself if you want to use it in the best way possible.

### How to self-host

1. Download **bot.js**
2. Navigate to the file directory of **bot.js** on your computer and open a Terminal / Command Prompt window in the directory.
3. Type `node bot.js` into the window.
4. The bot will be online!

#### Dependencies

To self-host, you will need two third-party dependencies.

[**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org) & discord.js `npm install discord.js`

Please note that in order to perform `npm install discord.js` you will need to have already installed Node.js on your computer
